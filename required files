this project does not includes node_modules fiels which is required for the this app to run. if you are downloading this project make sure
you add node_module package throught NPM.
you can type in the NPM command line
->npm init express --save
just use this line and keep changing the required package name in the command line for example: in place of express you can write mongoose 
that is npm init mongoose --save
thanks.
